# How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML,CSS,BootStrap

I started by working on the Design , making many proto-types of the hero sections and jumbrtons, footer etc.i designed each and every structure of the layout. After settling with the design ,i made the html skeleton.i used bootstrap to give the elements the design and structure.After giving the default style to the elements i customized them more using css.i overridden the bootstrap style by changing the respective class properties.To add the hamburger menu no javascript was used instead bootstrap data toggler came handy.

## Lessons Learned :

Bootstrap makes it very easy to customize a website . all the css properties are added in the html skeleton.like padding-top:2px is "pt-2" in bootstrap . these properties are added to the class attribute. media queries were used to make the layout shrink with respect to the viewports.What you do with a grid in css is done in the class attribute when used bootstrap.the grid template areas is set in the class attribute. adding nav-bar , nav-item made the elements line up automatically without having to add flex or float properties.boot strap made it so simple to add a menu button with these class names "navbar-collapse data-toggler" etc.
